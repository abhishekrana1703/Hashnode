#### Overview

Our goal is to enable users to submit a GitHub repository creation request through ServiceNow, which, after approval, will automatically create the repository on GitHub. This process involves:

1. ServiceNow as the request and approval platform.
    
2. A script or function to connect with GitHub's API.
    
3. Integration between ServiceNow and the automation script.
    

#### Requirements

* **ServiceNow access** with customization capabilities (e.g., ServiceNow Developer access).
    
* **GitHub access token** with permissions to create repositories.
    
* **Serverless or automation environment** (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, or a dedicated server) to run the GitHub API integration script.
    
* **Webhook or API endpoint** to trigger the script from ServiceNow.
    

#### Step 1: ServiceNow Request Form Setup

1. **Create a Service Catalog Item**: In ServiceNow, create a new catalog item titled “GitHub Repository Request.”
    
2. **Design the Request Form**: Include fields to capture repository details, such as:
    
    * **Repository Name** (text field)
        
    * **Description** (text area)
        
    * **Visibility** (choice field: Public or Private)
        
    * **Team/Owner** (dropdown for department or team requesting the repo)
        
    * **Approval Workflow** (if specific managers need to approve)
        
3. **Approval Flow**: Configure ServiceNow’s approval workflow. Once a user submits a request, route it to the designated approver(s) based on criteria (e.g., department).
    

#### Step 2: GitHub API Integration Script

This script can be written in Python, Node.js, or any language that supports HTTP requests to GitHub’s API. Here’s an example in Python:

```python
import requests

def create_github_repo(repo_name, description, visibility, access_token):
    url = "https://api.github.com/orgs/YOUR_ORG_NAME/repos"
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {access_token}",
        "Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3+json"
    }
    payload = {
        "name": repo_name,
        "description": description,
        "private": True if visibility.lower() == 'private' else False
    }
    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)
    
    if response.status_code == 201:
        return f"Repository '{repo_name}' created successfully!"
    else:
        return f"Failed to create repository: {response.json()}"
```

**Explanation:**

* `repo_name`, `description`, and `visibility` are input parameters, gathered from ServiceNow.
    
* `access_token` is a GitHub Personal Access Token with permissions to create repositories within the organization.
    
* The API endpoint used here (`/orgs/YOUR_ORG_NAME/repos`) is for organization-level repo creation.
    

#### Step 3: Triggering the Script from ServiceNow

1. **REST API in ServiceNow**: Configure a REST outbound integration in ServiceNow that can trigger the script.
    
2. **Webhook/API Gateway**: Use a webhook or API gateway to listen for ServiceNow events. When a new repository request is approved, ServiceNow can call this endpoint, triggering the GitHub API script.
    
3. **Parameters Passing**: Configure ServiceNow to pass the repository name, description, visibility, and any other parameters to the script.
    

#### Step 4: Implementing Notifications and Error Handling

1. **Success and Failure Notifications**: Set up notifications in ServiceNow to inform the requestor of success or failure:
    
    * **Success**: Notify the requestor with the repository URL.
        
    * **Failure**: Notify the requestor and admin team with error details.
        
2. **Error Handling in the Script**: Add logging and error handling within the script to capture and handle issues with API calls or incorrect permissions.
    

#### Example Workflow

1. **User Request**: A user submits a GitHub repository request through ServiceNow.
    
2. **Approval**: The request routes to the approver, who reviews and approves it.
    
3. **Trigger Script**: Once approved, ServiceNow sends the request details to the webhook/API endpoint.
    
4. **Repository Creation**: The automation script uses the GitHub API to create the repository.
    
5. **Notification**: ServiceNow notifies the user about the repository creation status.
    

#### Best Practices

* **Access Token Security**: Store the GitHub access token securely (e.g., in AWS Secrets Manager or similar).
    
* **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging in the automation script to troubleshoot issues and monitor the process.
    
* **Error Notifications**: Set up alerts for failures so that the DevOps team can quickly address issues.
    

#### Conclusion

By automating the GitHub repository creation process through ServiceNow, organizations can improve efficiency, security, and consistency. This setup minimizes the time developers spend on administrative tasks, allowing them to focus more on development.
