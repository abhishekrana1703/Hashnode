Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) of software projects. It automates the building, testing, and deployment of applications, allowing developers to integrate code changes frequently and deliver high-quality software efficiently. Here's how Jenkins works:

1. **Setup and Configuration**: Jenkins is typically installed on a server, either on-premises or in the cloud. After installation, users configure Jenkins through its web interface, setting up various parameters such as version control repositories, build triggers, and build environments.
    
2. **Jobs and Pipelines**: In Jenkins, tasks are organized into jobs or pipelines. A job represents a single task, such as compiling code, running tests, or deploying an application. Pipelines, on the other hand, are a series of interconnected jobs that define the entire CI/CD workflow, from code integration to deployment.
    
3. **Version Control Integration**: Jenkins integrates with version control systems (VCS) like Git, Subversion, or Mercurial. When developers push code changes to the VCS repository, Jenkins can detect these changes and trigger build jobs automatically.
    
4. **Build Process**: When a build job is triggered, Jenkins retrieves the latest code from the VCS repository and starts the build process. This process may involve compiling source code, running automated tests, generating artifacts, and performing other tasks defined in the job configuration.
    
5. **Test Automation**: Jenkins supports various testing frameworks and tools for automating software testing. It can execute unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests as part of the build process, providing immediate feedback to developers on the quality of their code changes.
    
6. **Artifact Management**: Jenkins can generate and archive build artifacts, such as compiled binaries, documentation, and installation packages. These artifacts are stored in Jenkins or external repositories for future reference or deployment.
    
7. **Continuous Delivery**: For CD, Jenkins can automate the deployment of applications to different environments, such as development, staging, and production. It can interact with deployment tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, or custom scripts to orchestrate the deployment process.
    
8. **Monitoring and Notifications**: Jenkins provides monitoring and reporting capabilities to track build and deployment status, identify issues, and analyze trends over time. It also supports notifications via email, chat, or other communication channels to alert users about build failures or other events.
    
9. **Extensibility**: Jenkins has a rich ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality. Users can install plugins to integrate Jenkins with third-party tools, customize build processes, and add additional features according to their requirements.
    

In summary, Jenkins automates the software development lifecycle by orchestrating build, test, and deployment processes. It improves productivity, accelerates time-to-market, and ensures the reliability and quality of software releases through continuous integration and delivery.
